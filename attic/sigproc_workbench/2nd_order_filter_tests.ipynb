    "# Summary\n",
    "This is a (relatively) simple Jupyter Notebook to allow experimenting with the different properties of various second-order low-pass filters, the ones that are available in the dycov tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IEC standard prescribes using a 2nd-order, critically damped filter, presumably because it strikes a good balance between simplicity, frequency rolloff at fc (i.e., how good the filter rejects frequencies above fc) and phase delay properties (i.e., how good the filter preserves the original waveform in the time domain).  But it could be argued that in our case (the dycov tool), it's the last criterion that matters most: we want to filter high frequency \"noise\" while preserving the waveform as much as possible. It is not always clear which type of filter achieves this. For instance, if we filter by forward-backward sweeping (filtfilt), phase delay gets compensated and it doesn't matter anymore; in that case it's more important that the filter doesn't have \"ringing\" effects in the step response in the time domain.\n",
    "Could a Bessel filter be better, then? (in theory it minimizes those ringing effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, this Notebook lets you experiment with all these filters and see the effect on test signals.  You may use square wave signals as the most extreme case, the one in which you will see the most differences between filters. But bear in mind that the dycov tool explicitly excludes sharp transtions by means of windowing plus considering exclusion windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe a more important setting to play with is how *signal boundaries* are handled, in other words, the **initialization** of the filer.\n"
