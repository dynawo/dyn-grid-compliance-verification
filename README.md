[![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sphinx/badge/?version=master)](https://dycov.github.io/index.html)

A tool for automating the verification of dynamic grid compliance requirements
for solar, wind, and storage farms (Power Park Modules - PPM) as well as
synchronous machines (SM), including:

  * validation of RMS models (a.k.a. _"phasor models"_) for PPM
  * verification of electric performance requirements for both PPM and SM

The tool is pre-configured to use the tests required by the French connection
network code (i.e., those of RTE's
[DTR](https://www.services-rte.com/files/live//sites/services-rte/files/documentsLibrary/20240729_DTR_5867_fr)
Fiches "I"), but it can be easily configured and extended to run other tests.

# Overview

The **Dynamic grid Compliance Verification** tool (DyCoV for short) is designed
to automate most tasks related to the validation of RMS models, in the context
of compliance requirements for new generation facilities. It contemplates
**model validation** properly speaking (i.e., _"does the model and its
parameterization match the actual behavior?"_), as well as **electric
performance** requirements testing (i.e., _"does the behavior, either measured
or simulated, pass the grid code requirements for connection?"_).

The tool is built with **Python**. Internally it is structured as a series of
independent tests, each producing its own report in PDF. These tests correspond
to the _Fiches I*_ in RTE's DTR document. To be specific, they contain the
following tests:

* **Electric Performance tests (Synchronous Machines)**: Fiches I2 (except
  stability margin calculations), I3, I4, I6, I7, I8, and I10.
* **Electric Performance tests (Power Park Modules)**: Fiches I2, I5, I6, I7, and I10.
* **RMS Model Validation tests (Power Park Modules)**: Fiche I16, structured into:
    - **Zone 1** (converter-level): Fault Ride-Through, Setpoint steps, Grid
      Frequency ramps, and Grid Voltage step.
    - **Zone 3** (plant-level): Voltage Regulation behavior (like I2), Fault
      Ride-Through (like I5), Voltage-dip Ride-Through (like I6), Voltage-swell
      Ride-Through (like I7), and Islanding (like I10).

Correspondingly, the results directory is structured along these lines.

Usually, the inputs are simply three files: the **DYD** and **PAR** files
corresponding to the [Dyna&omega;o](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo) model on
the producer's side (i.e., everything "left" of the connection point, the PDR
bus), and an **INI** file containing the parameters and metadata that cannot be
provided in the DYD/PAR files. See the available examples in the `examples`
directory, at the top level of the git repository.  For more information about
these files, consult the [User Manual](docs/manual).

Additionally, in the case of _Model Validation_, the user must also provide the
**reference curves** for each test, against which the simulated curves will be
compared. They should be provided as a CSV file and a DICT file that describes
the format.  For more information about these files, consult the [User
Manual](docs/manual).

In the case of _Electric Performance_ testing, the user has also the option of
providing test curves, either to be used _instead of_ Dyna&omega;o simulations,
or to be used along Dyna&omega;o simulations (just for plotting both and
comparing them).

# DyCoV installation

## Linux installation

### System requirements

The requirements at the OS-level are rather minimal: one just needs a recent
Linux distribution in which you should install Dyna&omega;o's requirements, plus
**LaTeX** and **Python**. If you do not have any strong preference, we would
recommend Debian 12 or higher, as well as Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or higher.

To be more specific, we explicitly list here the packages to be installed,
assuming a Debian/Ubuntu system:

* Install the following packages, required by Dyna&omega;o:
  ```bash
  apt install curl unzip gcc g++ cmake
  ```

* Install these LaTeX packages:
  ```bash
   apt install texlive-base texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended \
               texlive-latex-extra texlive-science texlive-lang-french latexmk
  ```

* Install a basic Python installation (version 3.9 or higher), containing at
  least `pip` and the `venv` module:
   ```bash
   apt install python3-minimal python3-pip python3-venv
   ```

* Install git (the current installer relies on building the Python package from
  sources):
   ```bash
   apt install git
   ```

Note that the tool itself is a Python package. However, this package and all of
its dependencies (NumPy, etc.) will get installed at the user-level, i.e.,
inside the user's `$HOME` directory, under a _Python virtual environment_.


### Installation

1. Choose a base directory of your choice and run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -L https://github.com/dynawo/dyn-grid-compliance-verification/releases/download/v0.8.1/linux_install.sh | bash
   ```

   This script will install the DyCoV tool, together with a matching version of
   Dyna&omega;o, under your current directory in `$PWD/dycov`.  It will do so by
   cloning the latest stable release and building & installing the application
   (and all of its dependencies, such as NumPy, etc.) under a Python virtual
   environment.

2. Next, you must activate the virtual environment that has just been created: 
   ```bash
   source $PWD/dycov/activate_dycov
   ```

3. The tool is used via a single command `dycov` having several subcommands. Quickly
   check that your installation is working by running the help option, which will show
   you all available subcommands:
   ```bash
   dycov -h
   ```

4. Upon the first use, the tool will automatically compile the Modelica models
   internally defined by the tool. You can also run this command explicitly, as follows:
   ```bash
   dycov compile
   ```
   (Note: this command is also used to compile any new Modelica models custom-defined by the
   user; see the section below on [Compiling Modelica models](#compiling-modelica-models).)
   
The DyCoV application is now ready to use.



## Windows installation

### Installation

> [!NOTE]  
> The Windows installer described here will install not only the DyCoV tool, but
> also all of the other requirements for you. Read the next section if you are
> interested in the details of what is installed in the Operating System
> (Dynawo, C++ compiler, Python, LaTeX).

1. Download the [DyCoV's Windows Installer](https://github.com/dynawo/dyn-grid-compliance-verification/releases/download/v0.8.1/DyCoV_win_Installer.exe).

   In order to install the application, it is essential that the user has administrator rights. If the user is an administrator, there are no problems in unblocking the executable:
   
   ![Unblocking Executable](./docs/manual/source/usage/figs_installation/admin.png)

2. Next, execute the downloaded installer:

   This executable will install the DyCoV tool, together with a matching version of Dynawo,
   under the selected directory (default installation path: `c:/dycov`).  It will do this 
   by copying the latest stable version and compiling and installing the application (and 
   all its dependencies, such as NumPy, etc.) into a Python virtual environment. The 
   installer will also install any third-party applications required for the proper 
   functioning of the tool.

    The MikTex installer allows you to select the configuration that you want to apply. 
    For the tool to work correctly, you must select the "Yes" or "Ask me first" option on the 
    following screen:
    ![MikTex Installer Settings](./docs/manual/source/usage/figs_installation/miktex_settings.png)


3. Next, you must activate the virtual environment that has just been created by
   double-clicking on the DyCoV.bat file that has been created on the desktop.

   This action will open a new Command Prompt with the virtual environment
   activated where the tool can be used.  To finish using the tool, you only
   need to close the Command Prompt.

4. The tool is used via a single command `dycov` having several subcommands. Quickly
   check that your installation is working by running the help option, which will show
   you all available subcommands:
   ```winbatch
   dycov -h
   ```

5. Upon the first use, the tool will automatically compile the Modelica models
   internally defined by the tool. You can also run this command explicitly, as follows:
   ```winbatch
   dycov compile
   ```
   (Note: this command is also used to compile any new Modelica models custom-defined by the
   user; see the section below on [Compiling Modelica models](#compiling-modelica-models).)
   
The DyCoV application is now ready to use.


### System requirements (for manual installs)

> [!NOTE]  
> The Windows installer (described in the previous section) will install all of
> these system requirements for you. This is only here for your information, in
> case you would rather install any of these components yourself. After you have
> installed all this, you should still use the Windows installer to install the
> DyCoV tool (it will skip installing any of these OS requirements if they are
> already installed).

The requirements of the DyCoV tool at the OS-level are rather minimal: one just
needs a recent Windows distribution in which you should install **Dyna&omega;o**
(and its requirements), **LaTeX**, and **Python**. If you do not have any strong
preference, we would recommend Windows 10 or higher.

To be more specific, we explicitly list here the packages to be installed:

* Install Dyna&omega;o (v1.7.0 or later) and its required packages: Dyna&omega;o
  is a simulation platform required by this tool. Follow the steps outlined in
  the official Dyna&omega;o installation guide at [Dynawo Installation
  Guide](https://dynawo.github.io/install/).
   - **Nightly Version**: Download the **Nightly version** of Dynawo from the
     repository to ensure you have the latest features and updates.
   - During installation, you will also need the following tools:
     - **CMake**: CMake is used to configure the build process for
       Dynawo. Download it from [cmake.org](https://cmake.org/download/).
     - **Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019**: the Visual Studio compiler is
       required to compile custom Modelica models in Dynawo. You can download
       the free **Community Edition** of these tools from
       [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/older-downloads/). During
       the installation, select only the _"Desktop development with C++"_
       workload.

* Install LaTeX. You can choose between these two LaTeX distributions:
   - **MiKTeX**: Download it from [MiKTeX Download](https://miktex.org/download).
   - **TeX Live**: Download it from [TeX Live Download](https://www.tug.org/texlive/).

* Install a basic Python installation (version 3.9 or higher), containing at
  least `pip` and the `venv` module:
   - Go to the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Download the latest version of Python 3 (ensure that you select the option
     to add Python to the system PATH during installation).

Note that the DyCoV tool itself is a Python package. However, this package and
all of its dependencies (NumPy, etc.) will get installed under a *Python virtual
environment*.




# Quick start

The tool currently has different entry points, depending on what you want to use
it for:
* For **RMS model** validation: `dycov validate`
* For **electric performance** verification: `dycov performance`



## RMS model validations

In this mode the tool runs a set of _Model Validation tests_.  Some of these
tests resemble those of Fiches I, while some are different.  Of course, here one
is validating the model, not the electric performance; therefore, it is
mandatory to provide _reference curves_ as well as a model or producer curves.


Run the command with option `--help` (or `-h`) to get a quick overview of the
inputs you need to provide:
```
usage: dycov validate [-h] [-d] [-l LAUNCHER_DWO]
                     [-m PRODUCER_MODEL | -c PRODUCER_CURVES] [-p PCS]
                     [-o RESULTS_DIR] [-od]
                     [reference_curves]

positional arguments:
  reference_curves      enter the path to the folder containing the reference
                        curves for the Performance Checking Sheet (PCS)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           more debug messages
  -l LAUNCHER_DWO, --launcher_dwo LAUNCHER_DWO
                        enter the path to the Dynawo launcher
  -m PRODUCER_MODEL, --producer_model PRODUCER_MODEL
                        enter the path to the folder containing the
                        producer_model files (DYD, PAR, INI)
  -c PRODUCER_CURVES, --producer_curves PRODUCER_CURVES
                        enter the path to the folder containing the curves for
                        the Performance Checking Sheet (PCS)
  -p PCS, --pcs PCS     enter one Performance Checking Sheet (PCS) to validate
  -o RESULTS_DIR, --results_dir RESULTS_DIR
                        enter the path to the results dir
  -od, --only_dtr       validate using only the PCS defined in the DTR
```



## Electric performance verifications

In this mode the tool runs an execution pipeline consisting in a set of
pre-defined tests, those of _Fiches_ "I" in RTE's DTR. You would use the command
`dycov performance` for _Synchronous Machines_ and for
_Power Park Modules_ (i.e. Wind and PV farms).

Run the command with option `--help` (or `-h`) to get a quick overview of the
inputs you need to provide:
```
usage: dycov performance [-h] [-d] [-l LAUNCHER_DWO] [-m PRODUCER_MODEL]
                    [-c PRODUCER_CURVES] [-p PCS] [-o RESULTS_DIR] [-od]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           more debug messages
  -l LAUNCHER_DWO, --launcher_dwo LAUNCHER_DWO
                        enter the path to the Dynawo launcher
  -m PRODUCER_MODEL, --producer_model PRODUCER_MODEL
                        enter the path to the folder containing the
                        producer_model files (DYD, PAR, INI)
  -c PRODUCER_CURVES, --producer_curves PRODUCER_CURVES
                        enter the path to the folder containing the curves for
                        the Performance Checking Sheet (PCS)
  -p PCS, --pcs PCS     enter one Performance Checking Sheet (PCS) to validate
  -o RESULTS_DIR, --results_dir RESULTS_DIR
                        enter the path to the results dir
  -od, --only_dtr       validate using only the PCS defined in the DTR
```

Note that, in this mode, the tool can perform the electrical performance
verification using either a user-provided Dyna&omega;o **model** (running
Dyna&omega;o simulations), or a set of user-provided **curves**, or both (in
which case the curves are used only for showing them on the graphs, along the
simulated curves). Therefore you must provide either a `PRODUCER_MODEL` or a
`PRODUCER_CURVE` directory, or both.

The options and the required format of INI and curves files are documented in
the tool's [User Manual](docs/manual). For the format of DYD and PAR files (that
is, the Dyna&omega;o model of the producer's facilities), see the [Dyna&omega;o
documentation](https://dynawo.github.io/docs/).




# Running examples

In the `examples` folder (located at the first level inside the cloned
repository) one can find several valid input files that can be used as
examples.

## Model Validation Example:

```
dycov validate $PWD/dycov/examples/Model/Wind/IEC2015/ReferenceCurves -m $PWD/dycov/examples/Model/Wind/IEC2015/Dynawo
```

Upon execution, the screen output should be similar to the
following. Additionally, all results will be generated in a (newly created)
results directory. PDF reports for each kind of test will be found in the 'Reports'
subdirectory within the results' directory. If run with `--debug`, all Dyna&omega;o simulations are
also preserved inside this directory, so that they can be inspected and re-run
for deeper analysis, if desired.

## Electrical Performance Example:

```
dycov performance -m $PWD/dycov/examples/SM/Dynawo/SingleAux
```

Upon execution, the screen output should be similar to the
following. Additionally, all results will be generated in a (newly created)
results directory. PDF reports for each kind of test will be found in the 'Reports'
subdirectory within the results' directory. If run with `--debug`, all Dyna&omega;o simulations are
also preserved inside this directory, so that they can be inspected and re-run
for deeper analysis, if desired.

# Configuration

The tool is configured via a `config.ini` file, written in the well-known INI
format (of the [Python
flavor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html)). The location of
this file follows the customary standard of each platform for application data:

* Under Linux: `$HOME/.config/dycov/`
* Under Windows: `%APPDATA%\Local\dycov`

Besides the `config.ini` file, there is a subfolder named `ddb`, which will
contain all compiled preassembled Modelica models (see next section).

The supplied INI file contains just the options that most users of the tool
would want to change, but there exist many more internal configuration options
that may be overriden in this INI file.  For more information about
configuration, including more advanced tasks such as adding a whole new test,
consult the [User Manual](docs/manual).



# Compiling Modelica models

The tool uses some _preassembled_ Modelica models defined internally, and the
user may also define additional ones of his own. They should be compiled by
using the supplied script, `dycov compile`.

As mentioned above, all compiled models (both the tool's and the user's) will be
saved under the tool's config directory, in the `ddb` subfolder. All of the
compilation output (standard output and standard error messages) will also be
logged there, in a file named `compile.log`.

For models provided by the user, the definition files `*.xml, *.mo, *.extvar`
may be located anywhere, but upon compilation they will be _copied_ to a
subfolder `user_models`, sibling to the `ddb` subfolder.

In case of upgrading the version of Dyna&omega;o, you may want to recompile all
models. You can easily do this by running the command with only the `--force`
option.

Run the command with option --help (or -h) to get a quick overview of the inputs
you need to provide:
```
usage: dycov compile [-h] [-d] [-l LAUNCHER_DWO] [-m DYNAWO_MODEL] [-f]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           more debug messages
  -l LAUNCHER_DWO, --launcher_dwo LAUNCHER_DWO
                        enter the path to the Dynawo launcher
  -m DYNAWO_MODEL, --dynawo_model DYNAWO_MODEL
                        XML file describing a custom Modelica model
  -f, --force           force the recompilation of all Modelica models (the
                        user's and the tool's own)
```

# For developers

## Build and install on Linux

1. Clone the repository via: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dynawo/dyn-grid-compliance-verification dycov_repo
   ```
   (you may of course use any name for the top-level directory, here `"dycov_repo"`.)
   
2. Get into the repository and run the shell script named `build_and_install.sh`.
   This builds the Python package, creates a Python virtual environment under
   the subdirectory `dycov_venv`, and installs the package into it (together with
   all the necessary library dependencies, such as NumPy, etc.).

3. Next, you must activate the virtual environment that has just been created: 
   ```bash
   source dycov_venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. The tool is used via a single command `dycov` having several subcommands. Quickly
   check that your installation is working by running the help option, which will show
   you all available subcommands:
   ```bash
   dycov -h
   ```

5. Upon the first use, the tool will automatically compile the Modelica models
   internally defined by the tool. You can also run this command explicitly, as follows:
   ```bash
   dycov compile
   ```
   (Note: this command is also used to compile any new Modelica models custom-defined by the
   user; see the section below on [Compiling Modelica models](#compiling-modelica-models).)
   
The DyCoV application is now ready to use.

## Build and install on Windows

1. Clone the Repository
   The first step is to clone the repository to your local machine. Using GitHub Desktop:
   - Open GitHub Desktop and click **File** > **Clone repository**.
   - Enter the following URL to clone the repository:
         
   ```winbatch
     git clone https://github.com/dynawo/dyn-grid-compliance-verification dycov_repo
   ```
   (you may of course use any name for the top-level directory, here `"dycov_repo"`.)

   - Choose a local directory where you want to save the repository and click **Clone**.

2. Set Up Virtual Environment
   A virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies for the project. This ensures that the package uses the correct Python version and dependencies without affecting other projects on your system.
   - Open a **CMD terminal** (Command Prompt) as administrator.
   - Navigate to the root folder of the cloned repository using the `cd` command:
         
   ```winbatch
     cd dycov_repo
   ```

   - Create a new virtual environment with:
         
   ```winbatch
     python.exe -m venv dycov_venv
   ```
     
   - This will create a directory `dycov_venv` in your repository folder.
   
3. Build the Package
   The next step is to compile the package into a distributable format:
       
   ```winbatch
   	python.exe -m build
   ```
   
   - This command will create the necessary build files in the `dist` folder of the repository. The build process might take a few minutes to complete.

4. Activate the Virtual Environment
   Now that the virtual environment is created, activate it to use the isolated environment:
       
   ```winbatch
   	dycov_venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   - Once activated, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that the virtual environment is active (e.g., `(dycov_venv)` at the beginning of the prompt).

5. Install the Package
   Once the package is built, you can install it using pip. Use the following command to install the `.whl` (Wheel) file generated during the build:
       
   ```winbatch
   	python.exe -m pip install dist\dycov....whl
   ```
   
   - This will install the package into your active virtual environment.

6. Verify Installation
   After installation, verify that the tool was installed correctly by running the following command:
       
   ```winbatch
   	dycov -h
   ```
   
   - This should display the help message for the `dyn-grid-compliance-verification` tool, confirming that the installation was successful.

7. Pre-Execution Compilation
   Before running the tool for the first time, it's recommended to compile the tool's resources:
       
   ```winbatch
   	dycov compile
   ```
   
   - This step ensures that all necessary files are generated and compiled for optimal performance.

The DyCoV application is now ready to use.

Finally, if you want to further _develop_ the source code of this tool, consult
the [Developer Manual](docs/manual_dev).
