=============
Configuration
=============

Dynamic Grid Compliance Verification has multiple configuration files, written in the
well-known INI format (of the `Python flavor`__). This guide introduces the
configuration parameters defined in each file. These configuration files are
grouped into 3 types, in order to set the overriding priority of settings. The
priority defined in the tool configuration is:

1. User Configuration
2. :ref:`PCS Configuration <pcsconf>`
3. :ref:`Dynamic Grid Compliance Verification Configuration <toolconf>`

PCS Configuration
-------------------

This section explains the particular configuration of a *PCS*. Each
implemented *PCS* must have its own configuration PCSDescription.ini file, which is located in
the ``src/dgcv/templates/PCS/`` directory of the tool.
These configuration files should only be edited by developers, and only if there is
any update of the DTR compliance document concerning the *PCS*.

values present in the configuration file. If the value depends on the type of generator, the text that identifies
the generator must be added to the variable name in the configuration file.

Example of a variable that does not depend on the type of generator: ``u_ret``
Example of a variable that depends on the type of generator: ``u_ret_HTB1``

It is also possible to assign placeholders in the following TSOModel files, so that the tool will replace them with
