=============
Configuration
=============

DyCoV uses a layered configuration system where settings can be defined at
different levels, each overriding the one below it. Understanding this
hierarchy is key to knowing where to make changes and how they propagate
through the tool.

The configuration is written in the standard INI format
(`Python flavor <https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html>`_)
and organized into three levels, in decreasing order of priority:

1. **User Configuration** — settings provided by the user in
   ``~/.config/dycov/config.ini``. These always take precedence.
2. :ref:`PCS Configuration <pcsconf>` — settings defined per PCS in
   ``src/dycov/templates/PCS/``. These should only be modified when a DTR
   update changes the PCS definition.
3. :ref:`Tool Configuration <toolconf>` — global defaults in
   ``src/dycov/configuration/defaultConfig.ini``. These should only be
   modified when a DTR update changes global conditions.


.. _pcsconf:

PCS Configuration
------------------

Each PCS has its own ``PCSDescription.ini`` file, located under
``src/dycov/templates/PCS/<workflow>/<technology>/<PCSName>/``. This file
defines the complete structure of the PCS — its benchmarks, operating
conditions, validation tests, and report curves.

These files should only be edited by developers, and only when a DTR update
requires it.


PCS structure parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under ``[PCS-Benchmarks]``:

* ``PCSName``
    Comma-separated list of Benchmarks that belong to the PCS.

Under ``[PCS-OperatingConditions]``:

* ``PCSName.BenchmarkName``
    Comma-separated list of Operating Conditions for the given Benchmark.


Validation tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under ``[Performance-Validations]``, define which Performance Validation tests
each Benchmark or Operating Condition must pass. Available tests:

* ``static_diff`` — static difference between the controlled quantity and the
  voltage adjustment setpoint.

  prioritized over active power.

Benchmark or Operating Condition must pass. Available tests:

  10% of step height.

* ``response_time`` — time from step command until measured value first enters
  the tolerance range of the target value.

  tolerance range for the last time.
* ``overshoot`` — difference between maximum response and final steady-state
  value.
* ``ramp_time_lag`` — tracking error time.
* ``ramp_error`` — tracking error value.
* ``mean_absolute_error_power_1P`` — P and Q MAE must not exceed 1% of Pmax.
* ``mean_absolute_error_injection_1P`` — active and reactive injection MAE
  must not exceed 1% of Pmax.
* ``mean_absolute_error_voltage`` — voltage MAE.
* ``voltage_dips_active_power`` — P ME, MAE and MXE within thresholds.

  thresholds.
* ``setpoint_tracking_reactive_power`` — ME, MAE and MXE of reactive power
  within thresholds.


Report curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under ``[ReportCurves]``, define which figures appear in the PCS report by
listing the Benchmarks or Operating Conditions that should include each graph:

* ``fig_P`` — active power at the PDR bus.
* ``fig_Q`` — reactive power at the PDR bus.

* ``report_name`` — name of the LaTeX file used for the PCS summary report.
* ``id`` — PCS identifier, used to sort the final report.
* ``zone`` — Zone 1 or Zone 3 (for RMS Model Validation only).

Under ``[PCSName.BenchmarkName]``:

* ``job_name`` — name used to populate the Dynawo JOBS file.
* ``TSO_model`` — Dynawo model name for the TSO network of the PCS.
* ``Omega_model`` — Dynawo model name for the Omega model of the PCS.

Under ``[PCSName.BenchmarkName.OCName]``:

* ``report_name`` — LaTeX file name for the Operating Condition report.
* ``reference_step_size`` — step magnitude for reference tracking tests,
  used to scale the compliance tolerance. Optional.
* ``bolted_fault`` — whether the fault test uses a bolted fault.

* ``setpoint_change_test_type`` — type of setpoint affected in step tests.

Under ``[PCSName.BenchmarkName.OCName.Model]``:

  single Operating Condition. Optional.
* ``SCR`` — Short-Circuit Ratio. Optional.
* ``pdr_P``, ``pdr_Q``, ``pdr_U`` — initial P, Q, and voltage at the PDR.

The infinite bus table configuration also lives in this section. The tool
replaces placeholders found in the ``TableInfiniteBus.txt`` file with the
values defined here. If a value depends on the generator type, append the
type identifier to the variable name (e.g. ``u_ret_HTB1``).

The same placeholder substitution applies to the TSO model files
(``TSOModel.jobs``, ``TSOModel.dyd``, ``TSOModel.par``). Commonly used
examples:

* ``main_P0Pu``, ``main_Q0Pu``, ``main_U0Pu`` — initial conditions for the
  main load.
* ``secondary_P0Pu``, ``secondary_Q0Pu``, ``secondary_U0Pu`` — initial
  conditions for the secondary load.

Under ``[PCSName.BenchmarkName.OCName.Event]``:

* ``connect_event_to`` — Dynawo model variable where the step is connected.
* ``sim_t_event_start`` — event start time (s).
* ``fault_duration`` — fault duration until line disconnection (s). When this
  depends on generator type, declare ``fault_duration_HTB1``,
  ``fault_duration_HTB2``, ``fault_duration_HTB3`` separately.
* ``setpoint_step_value`` — increment applied after the step trigger.
