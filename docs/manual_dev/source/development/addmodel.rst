Adding a new dynamic model
==========================

Dynamic Grid Compliance Verification is a tool  designed to carry out several tests related to
RTE's grid code requirements on new generating plants that want to connect to the grid. It
implements the tests defined in RTE's DTR document, the so called "PCSs" of type "I" (I2, I3,
etc.).  These PCSs include compliance tests for both electric performance requirements as well as
RMS model fidelity requirements.

This tool is based on Dynawo, RTE's dynamic network simulator. Dynawo has a large library of models
covering most of the modeling needs of new power generation projects. However, the tool does not
automatically support all of Dynawo's models: if a new model is added to Dynawo's library, or if an
existing one modifies its parameters or variable names, some additions or modifications will be
needed in this Tool in order to support those changes.

The two subsections below describe these additions, and how they should be prepared:
   * Dynawo Models "Master Dictionary": describes the internal dictionary that maps
     variable/parameter names used by each specific model to the tool's generic names.
   * Dynawo Model Description: describes the ``ini`` file that should be
     prepared for each new Dynawo model that the tool may need to support.




Dynawo Models "Master Dictionary"
---------------------------------

Anytime the DGCV tool needs to read/modify a variable or a parameter in the PAR or CRV Dynawo files,
it needs to know the precise name of that variable/parameter *for the particular Dynawo model in
question*.  Therefore, the tool needs to maintain an internal dictionary that maps the
variable/parameter names used by each specific model to the tool's generic names. This dictionary
is located in the ``src/dgcv/dynawo/dictionary`` of the tool.

To add support for a new Dynawo model in the Dynamic Grid Compliance Verification Tool, it is necessary
to modify the ``ini`` file corresponding to the type of equipment to which it belongs (``bus.ini,
control_modes.ini, generator.ini, line.ini, load.ini, power_park.ini, transformer.ini``) and link
the keywords used in the Tool with the corresponding Dynawo parameter of the model.

Control Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Tool uses this dictionary to define the valid options of control modes by:

* test type (USetpoint or QSetpoint)
* family (WECC or IEC)
* level (Plant or Turbine

Under the ``ControlModes`` section the list of valid options for configuring the control mode
is defined by dividing the models according to the mentioned characteristics. The parameter name
must be created using the following rule:

    ``testType_family_level``

An example of the ``ControlModes`` section:

.. code-block:: console

    [ControlModes]
    USetpoint_WECC_Plant = WTG_UControl_Local_Coordinated,WTG_Only_UControl
    QSetpoint_WECC_Plant = WTG_QControl_Local_Coordinated,WTG_Only_QControl

    USetpoint_WECC_Turbine = WT_Local_Coordinated,WT_UControl
    QSetpoint_WECC_Turbine = WT_Local_Coordinated,WT_QControl

    USetpoint_IEC_Plant = IECWPP_UQStatic,IECWPP_Openloop_UQStatic,IECWPP_UControl
    QSetpoint_IEC_Plant = IECWPP_QControl,IECWPP_Openloop_QControl

    USetpoint_IEC_Turbine = IECWT_UControl
    QSetpoint_IEC_Turbine = IECWT_QControl,IECWT_Openloop_QControl


A section is defined below for each of the previously configured options. These sections consist
of the dynamic model parameters that need to be configured and the value to be applied.

An example of a valid option section for a WECC dynamic model:

.. code-block:: console

    [WTG_UControl_Local_Coordinated]
    PfFlag = False
    VFlag = True
    QFlag = True
    RefFlag = True


An example of a valid option section for a IEC dynamic model:

.. code-block:: console

    [IECWPP_UQStatic]
    MqG = 1
    MwpqMode = 2
