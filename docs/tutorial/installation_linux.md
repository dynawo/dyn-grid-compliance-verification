## Overview

Dynamic Grid Compliance Verification is developed in `Python` and requires 
**Python 3.9+**. It relies on several third-party libraries which will be 
automatically installed along with the tool when using the `build_and_install.sh` 
script. However there are some required packages that should be installed manually.

## Install Dynawo
The first requirement to use the tool is to have Dynawo installed on your computer. 
To do so, follow the steps provided in the [official software repository](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo) or 
on the [official page](https://dynawo.github.io/install/).

For optimal functionality of the package, Dynawo version v1.7.0 or later is required, 
which should be obtained from the **nightly** builds of the official repository 
(currently, as of September 2024, only available as a [Nightly release](https://github.com/dynawo/dynawo/releases)).

This must be the version with Open Modelica integrated.

It's important to remember that Dynawo requires a series of dependencies that can be 
installed with the following command:

```bash
apt install curl unzip gcc g++ cmake
```

Finally, to verify that Dynawo has been installed correctly, you can use the following 
command:

```bash
dynawo.sh --version
```

## System Requirements

The OS-level requirements are quite minimal. Youâ€™ll need a recent Linux distribution, 
along with `Dynawo` (and its dependencies), **LaTeX**, and **Python**. We recommend 
using Debian 12 or later, or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or newer. A Windows version is planned 
to be released by the end of 2024.

For Debian/Ubuntu systems, the following packages need to be installed:

* **Install Dynawo** (v1.7.0 or later) and its necessary dependencies (previous step)

* **Install LaTeX packages**:

    ```bash
    apt install texlive-base texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra \
                texlive-latex-recommended texlive-science texlive-lang-french \
                make
    ```

* **Install Python 3.9 or higher**, including `pip` and the `venv` module:

    ```bash
    apt install python3.9-minimal python3-pip python3.9-venv
    ```
    
 
* **Install xdg-utils (Optional)**: 
   This package includes `xdg-open`, which may not be installed by default. It is used 
* for opening automatically the PDF reports:

    ```
    apt install xdg-utils
    ```

Note that this tool is also distributed as a Python package. Once installed, it, along 
with its dependencies, will be placed in a *Python virtual environment* inside your 
`$HOME` directory.

## Installation

1. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   curl https://github.com/dynawo/dyn-grid-compliance-verification/releases/download/v0.6.0/linux_install.sh | bash
   ```

   This will download the lastest version of the Python package,
   create a Python virtual environment under the subdirectory `dgcv_venv`, and
   install the package into it (together with all the necessary library 
   dependencies, such as NumPy, etc.).

2. Next, you must activate the virtual environment that has just been created: 
   ```bash
   source dgcv_venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. The tool is used via a single command `dgcv` having several subcommands. Quickly
   check that your installation is working by running the help option, which will show
   you all available subcommands:
   ```bash
   dgcv -h
   ```

4. Upon the first use, the tool will automatically compile the Modelica models
   internally defined by the tool. You can also run this command explicitly, as follows:
   ```bash
   dgcv compile
   ```
   (Note: this command is also used to compile any new Modelica models custom-defined by the
   user; see the section below on [Compiling Modelica models](#compiling-modelica-models).)
   
The dgcv application is now ready to use.


## Build and install (for developers)

* **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dynawo/dyn-grid-compliance-verification dgcv_repo
    ```

    You can rename the top-level directory to something other than `"dgcv_repo"` if you wish.

* **Navigate to the repository** and run the `build_and_install.sh` script. This will 
  build the Python package, create a virtual environment inside the `dgcv_venv` 
  subdirectory, and install the tool along with all required dependencies.

* **Activate the virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    source dgcv_venv/bin/activate
    ```

    **Note:** The tool includes a built-in sanity check to ensure that all necessary system 
              requirements are installed, and will notify you if any are missing.
    

* **First run**:
The first time the tool is run from a clean state, a configuration folder will be created
in $HOME/.config/dgcv, and the models will be compiled with Open Modelica. This process
may take several minutes and will only need to be repeated if the Dynawo version is updated.
