Welcome to Dynamic grid Compliance Verification's documentation!
================================================================

The **Dynamic grid Compliance Verification** tool (dycov for short) is designed to automate
most tasks related to the validation of RMS models, in the context of compliance
requirements for new generation facilities. It contemplates **model validation**
properly speaking (i.e., *"does the model and its parameterization match the
actual behavior?"*), as well as **electric performance** requirements testing
(i.e., *"does the behavior, either measured or simulated, pass the grid code
requirements for connection?"*).

The tool is built with **Python**. Internally it is structured as a series of independent
tests, each producing its own report in PDF. These tests correspond to the
*PCSs I** in RTE's Connection Network code - `DTR document`__. To be specific, they contain the following
tests:

* **Electric Performance tests (Synchronous Machines)**: PCSs I2 (except
  stability margin calculations), I3, I4, I6, I7, I8, and I10.
* **Electric Performance tests (Power Park Modules)**: PCSs I2 (except
  stability margin calculations), I5, I6, I7, and I10.
* **RMS Model Validation tests (Power Park Modules)**: PCS I16, structured into:
    - **Zone 1** (WT-level): Fault Ride-Through, Setpoint steps, Grid Frequency ramps, and Grid Voltage step.
    - **Zone 3** (plant-level): Voltage Regulation behavior (like I2), Fault
      Ride-Through (like I5), Voltage-dip Ride-Through (like I6), Voltage-swell Ride-Through
      (like I7), and Islanding (like I10).

Correspondingly, the results directory is structured along these lines.

Usually, the inputs are simply three files: the **DYD** and **PAR** files
corresponding to the Dynawo model on the producer's side (i.e., everything
"left" of the connection point, the PDR bus), and an **INI** file containing the parameters and metadata that cannot be provided in the DYD/PAR
files. It is also possible to provide a set of curves as input to the tool, these
should be provided as a file in one of the accepted formats plus a
special DICT file that describes the format (see :ref:`Producer Curves <producerCurves>` below).
See the available examples in the `examples` directory, at the top level of the git repository.

Additionally, in the case of *Model Validation*, the user must also provide the
**reference curves** for each test, against which the simulated curves will be
compared. They should be provided as a file in one of the accepted formats plus a
special DICT file that describes the format (see :ref:`Reference Curves <referenceCurves>`
below).

In the case of *Electric Performance* testing, the user has also the option of
providing test curves to be used along Dynawo simulations (just for plotting both
and comparing them).
